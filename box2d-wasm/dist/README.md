# Box2D Bindings for js / WASM

Provides js / WASM bindings for [Box2D](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d).

These bindings are optimized for usage in Kotlin multiplatform projects together with the corresponding Java bindings
available here: https://github.com/fabmax/box2d-jni

In case you are looking for a WASM version of Box2D to use with your favourite web-framework, you are probably better
off with [box2d3-wasm](https://github.com/Birch-san/box2d3-wasm).
